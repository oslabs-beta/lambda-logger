# Lambda-logger
Lambda Logger tackles post-deployment challenges by introducing an intuitive interface for swift log inspection. With JSON format logs and a custom parser for clarity, users gain accessible return values. Ensuring security, the application employs AWS IAM credentials for authentication, diminishing reliance on the sluggish AWS CloudWatch console.

## Features
- Dynamically Fetch Logs From CloudWatch
- Custom Log Interpreter
- Search Logs

## Instruction
- Visit https://lambdalogger.dev/, navigate to App, and enter your AWS temporary access credentials.
- From [Lambda-logger](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/lambda-logger), fork to your repo, then in the terminal, `git clone 'copied URL'`
- How to get the "access key" and "secret key" to log in?
    - From your AWS root account, you should have your own "IAM" user in your AWS account. If you do not have it yet, click [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html) to learn how to create it.
    - After getting "IAM user", in your AWS Console, at the `search bar`, search for `IAM` and click. Go to the `Users` tab, then choose the IAM user that you just created. In Summary, click `Create access key` --> choose `Local code` --> Check `I understand` box --> click `Next` --> In `Description tag value`, put any name you want to --> click `Create access key`

    - ![](./docs/assets/images/get-access-key.gif)

    - Now you should save the `Secret access key` somewhere(**Note:** This key is very sensitive, do NOT publish), or click on `Download .csv file` before clicking `Done`. If you forget this step, you never get that "Secret key access" anymore, unless you create a new one.

    - **Note:** You only can create up to "2 Access keys". If you want to create another one, you must delete the old one.
    - After getting the keys, get the region

- Since we have all stuff to log in, on the terminal run `npm install`, then `npm run dev`, navigate to http://localhost:8080/ to view the web application, and use both keys and region to access.

- Select the Log group and Log Stream you want to access from your "Lambda function", then you will get content that looks like this:

## Documentation
- How AWS SDK Is Implemented?
    - A software development kit (SDK) is a set of platform-specific building tools for developers. You require components like debuggers, compilers, and libraries to create code that runs on a specific platform, operating system, or programming language. SDKs put everything you need to develop and run software in one place. Additionally, they contain resources like documentation, tutorials, and guides as well as APIs and frameworks for faster application development.
    - We use The AWS SDK for JavaScript v3 API Reference Guide which provides a JavaScript API for AWS services. Particularly in this project, our team "AWS-SDK" to fetch data from CloudWatch.
    - For more info, click [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/welcome.html).

- React Syntax Highlighter
    - Syntax highlighting component for `React`` using the seriously super amazing [lowlight](https://github.com/wooorm/lowlight) and [refractor](https://github.com/wooorm/refractor) by [wooorm](https://github.com/wooorm).
    - Click [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-syntax-highlighter) for more information.

## OSP Information
### Testing
- How to test? Before testing, if you are in the server(after hitting `npm run dev`), exit the server(on the keyboard, press the combination "Control + C").
- **Note:** To ensure there is no bug/confliction, double check by running `lsof -i:3000` on the terminal, if it still exists, you may see its "PID" on your terminal, and you have to kill it(`kill -9 <PID>`) before do testing.
    - Run `npm run test` to test the whole app.
    - Run `npm run test <filename.js>` to test only that file.
